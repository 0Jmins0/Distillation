The current behavior is equivalent to passing `weights=AlexNet_Weights.IMAGENET1K_V1`. You can also use `weights=AlexNet_Weights.DEFAULT` to get the most up-to-date weights.

torch.OutOfMemoryError: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 56.00 MiB. GPU 0 has a total capacity of 23.69 GiB of which 14.19 MiB is free. Process 499389 has 11.25 GiB memory in use. Process 500626 has 3.23 GiB memory in use. Including non-PyTorch memory, this process has 1.93 GiB memory in use. Process 500623 has 2.43 GiB memory in use. Process 500625 has 4.81 GiB memory in use. Of the allocated memory 1.56 GiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 55.50 MiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True to avoid fragmentation.
